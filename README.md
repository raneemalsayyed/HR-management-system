<h2>Changes made on the JS file:</h2>


1.Replacing the object literals for all employees to a single constructer :
        A single constructer has been done for all employees with all their properties, rather than displaying each employee as an object.
         
2.Saving employees information into an array:
        All employees information inside the constructor will now be saved inside the array.
        Each time a new employee is defined, his/her information will also be saved inside the array automatically. 

3.Making all methods as a prototype method:
        This will make the method functions dynamic.
        The method functions is now easier to modify and control.

         document.write is used to present the information needed to be displayed on the browser.
